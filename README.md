Pizza Sales Analysis Project

Project Overview
This project involves the development of an SQL-based system to analyze pizza sales data. It aims to answer key business questions, optimize sales strategies, and improve operational efficiency through data-driven insights.

Features

1. **Database Design**
   - Created a relational database schema for pizza sales data.
   - Defined tables for orders, customers, pizzas, ingredients, and deliveries.
   - Established relationships to ensure data integrity.

2. **Data Ingestion**
   - Imported sales data from CSV files into the database.
   - Performed data cleaning and transformation for accuracy and consistency.

3. **Query Development**
   - Crafted SQL queries to answer business questions:
     - Total sales revenue over time.
     - Most popular pizza types and trends.
     - Customer purchase patterns and frequency.
     - Sales performance by location and delivery times.
     - Ingredient usage for inventory management.

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimized queries using indexing and query refactoring.
   - Employed aggregate functions, joins, subqueries, and window functions.

5. **Reporting and Visualization**
   - Generated summary reports and visualizations.
   - Provided actionable recommendations for business improvement.

Technologies Used
- SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server)
- Database Design and Normalization
- Data Import and Cleaning
- Query Optimization Techniques
- Reporting and Visualization Tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI)

Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**
   - SQL database system (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server)
   - SQL client tool (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin)
   - CSV files containing pizza sales data

2. **Setup**
   - Create a new database in your SQL system.
   - Import the database schema from the provided SQL script.
   - Load the CSV data into the respective tables.

3. **Running Queries**
   - Use the provided SQL query scripts to perform data analysis.
   - Modify and adapt queries to answer additional business questions.

4. **Generating Reports**
   - Use reporting tools like Tableau or Power BI to create visualizations from query results.
   - Customize reports to highlight key insights and recommendations.
